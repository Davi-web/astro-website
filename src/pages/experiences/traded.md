## Overview
I worked on a college start up app last summer called Traded, which is an
E-commerce app where college students can buy and sell items to
other college students on campus. I was in charge of developing
frontend UI's as well as connecting it to a backend that the team can use. The executives showed me sample screens that they wanted me to implment on **Marvel** and met with me weekly to discuss the progress of the project. I was the only person on the development team.


I had no experience in Web/Mobile development so there was steep learning curve I had to overcome. For the first month, I spent most of my days teaching myself how to use React Native and Firebase by looking through the documentations to understand how to integrate it as a BaaS(Backend as a Service). Then, I inplmented over 10 screens involving the app that was consistent with the style and UI that the executives wanted. While implementing these screens, I incorporated the logic for connecting the screen UI's and different functionalities executives specified in meetings. I used Firebase Auth to authenticate the users on the app and was able to store I was able to store data for users and product information using Firestore and images on Firebase Real Time Database.

## Takeways
After taking Principles of Software Engineering here at Vanderbilt, I learned different Agile methodologies to ensure that the project gets finishe on time.
