## Search 
I implemented the frontend for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search from scrach using HTML and CSS. I also had to make the sites responsive so that queries work the same as using the Google website. The hardest part of this project was making an "I'm Feeling Lucky" button that is consistent with Google's behavior.
