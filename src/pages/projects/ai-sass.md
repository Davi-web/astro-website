## Overview
For this project, I followed Code with Antonio's tutorial on how to build a SaaS application. This tutorial was very useful to me because it helped me reinforce my learnings for the new Next13 app router structure. I also learned how to use shadcn/ui, which is a frontend component library built on top of Radix/UI and Tailwind CSS. I felt that there was alot more room for customizing the components that you download from shadcn/ui as you can edit it to fit the design for your website.  

I was able to set up a subscription service for my application using Stripe. It was my first time working with webhooks and I felt that it was a very useful tool to use. I was able to set up a webhook that would listen for events from Stripe and update my database accordingly. I also learned how to use Stripe's checkout session to create a checkout page for my application. I was able to set up a free trial system where users can generate a limited free prompts before they have to upgrade to the pro tier using Stripe's checkout session.  

I took Artifical Intelligence course my senior year at Vanderbilt, but never really applied it to my projects. It was super cool to see how I could leverage AI so easily in my projects and I learned how to prompt engineer to give better outputs.  

## Takeaways
I feel like I learned alot more about React server componenets and how it works with the new Next13 app router. I also learned how to use Stripe's checkout session and how to use webhooks to listen for events from Stripe. I also learned how to use AI in my projects and how to prompt engineer to give better outputs. I also learned how to use shadcn/ui, which is a frontend component library built on top of Radix/UI and Tailwind CSS.
