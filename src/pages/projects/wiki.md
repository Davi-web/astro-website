## Wiki 
I implemented a wikipedia page where users can store information using MarkDown. Markdown is a markup language that helps you convert text to HTML easily. I had to allow the site to allow Markdown to HTML conversion and added functionalities like addind/editing a page, searching for a page, etc. Worked with Python and Django for this project.
