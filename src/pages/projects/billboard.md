For this project, I webscraped the Billboard Top 100 songs from their website and made a game where users can guess the ordering of the songs. Users can drag the songs to reorder the orderings and submit their answers when they are done guessing. The score will be calculated after users have made 10 guesses. This was the first project I made where I made a distinctive backend and frontend to follow good code practices. After scraping the data, I made an API call from the client side to retrieve the data. I used Node for the backend and used React for the frontend. **Click on the picture for the github code!**
