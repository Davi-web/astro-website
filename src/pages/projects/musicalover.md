## MusicaLover 
MusicaLover is a website that allows you to visualize your spotify account. When you log in with your spotify account, you will be redirected to your profile page where you can see your top artists, top songs, and top genres. You can also see your top songs and artists in a table format. Users can click on their playlists and will be able to sort tracks in their plyalists by three moods: Danceablity, Tempo, and Energy. This website was made using React styled with styled-components. The website is hosted on AWS EC2 using NGinx. [Click here to check it out!](https://musicalover.com)
