## Lingle 
Lingle is an adaptation to the popular New York Times game Wordle. My friend and I have made the game customizeable so that users can get unlimited tries and users can choose words of any length. Users can also play the game **unlimited times** and can choose between dark and light mode. We were able to deploy the website using Github Pages. Some challenges we faced when starting the project was figuring out how to display the input boxes, the user's guesses, and the keyboard on the screen.
