## Get Order App 
Vanderbilt University uses the GET CBORD application to manage student's fund. Students can order food through the app using meal swipes or meal money. There were some inconveniences ordering food from the app such as slow response times and the app logging you out if you switch between apps or if you're inactive for a long time, so I wanted a way to automate the process of ordering dining hall food with a click of a button. For this project, I used python selenium as a bot by querying with HTML selectors to log onto the GET CBORD website to order what I wanted, such as an omelet for the next morning.
